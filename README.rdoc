= Joint

MongoMapper and GridFS joined in file upload love.

== Usage

Declare the plugin and use the attachment method to make attachments.

  class Foo
    include Mongoid::Document
    plugin Joint

    attachment :image
    attachment :pdf
  end

This gives you #image, #image=, #pdf, and #pdf=. The = methods take any IO that responds to read (File, Tempfile, etc). The image and pdf methods return a GridIO instance (can be found in the ruby driver).

Also, #image and #pdf are proxies so you can do stuff like:

    doc.image.id, doc.image.size, doc.image.type, doc.image.name

If you call a method other than those in the proxy it calls it on the GridIO instance so you can still get at all the GridIO instance methods.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
